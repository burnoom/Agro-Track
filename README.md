## üöÄ About Us
We are a group of students from Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey at the Sonora Norte campus in the city of Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. We joined this competition because the challenges are not only difficult and rewarding, but also actively seek to achieve positive change in the world and how we interact with it. We joined NASA's cause to improve how we live and what the future holds for us.

##üîß How To 

###Next, all the steps carried out for the creation of the prototype were written in a methodology form. This project was devised after the team read the challengue and tried to reach a solution. We decided to develop a mobile app using the open-source UI software called "React Native" for coding. The coding language used for the developing of this mobile app is JavaScript. To access to the required data we needed to use some databases as "OpenSourceMap" and "AccuWeather" using API keys to access to the specific information needed for the mobile app.
